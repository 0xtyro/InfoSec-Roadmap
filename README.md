# InfoSec-Roadmap

The way I see it, there are a few paths to gain InfoSec knowledge, many resources available, and many items that overlap.  That is, I need Python & PowerShell skills but also need to stay on top of the news, and play with tools in a test lab, all while keeping eyes on a long-term target such as a cert or career change.

Here’s a high-level view of all the different things to focus on.  I’m sure this can grow greatly, but it’s plenty to keep me busy for now.
